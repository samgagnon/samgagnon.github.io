### Who is this guy?
I'm a master's student at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke. I study multi-messenger cosmology,
and am chasing the Hubble constant, which is sort of a white whale of cosmology at this point.

### What is he good at?
* Python all day every day
* ML development with Tensorflow and PyTorch? ez
* Writing very professional sentences
* Probably some other things too
