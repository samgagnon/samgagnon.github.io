I'm a master's student at Bishop's University working on a likelihood-free inference model to infer the Hubble constant from multi-messenger binary neutron star merger measurements. I work with [Prof. John Ruan](http://craq-astro.ca/un_membre/?lang=en&id=John_J.Ruan).

### Does this work?
It looks like it

### Features
* I can write things
* Embed files maybe?
* I'll have to figure that out

### Acknowledgements
I don't have any, but [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### The Name
My name was given to me by my parents. The same is true for most (but not all) other humans.
