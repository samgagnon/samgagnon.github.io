<h1>About Me</h1>
</center>

Samuel Gagnon-Hartman is a Ph.D. student in Physics at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. 
He is currently working on his thesis, "Multi-Messenger Probes of the Epoch of Reionization," under the 
supervision of Andrei Mesinger. His research involves developing methods for confirming a prospective 
detection of the 21-cm auto-correlation signal using other tracers of the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn.

    <p>
    To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not entirely sure. I have a lot of 
    ideas and documents floating around and I thought it would be fun to 
    have them all in one place. This should also serve as my "academic e-portfolio,"
    since that's something the youngins are looking for these days.

</dt><b><a name="danaan" class="i"> What does Danaan mean? </a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
    Danaan is the English rendering of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Danaan" 
    target="_top">&Delta;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&omicron;&#943;</a>,
    one of the most common demonyms used for the "Greeks" in the Illiad. Specifically, 
    it means "the people of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus" 
    target="_top">Danaus</a>." Danaus was the mythological founder of Argos, and thus father of 
    the Argives, another archaic demonym of the Greeks. What I find interesting about 
    his myth is his supposed Egyptian origin: that he was the second son of the King 
    of Egypt and fled along with his fifty daughters to Argos to escape the wrath of
    his brother, who had inherited the throne.
</p>

<p>
    By coincidence, Danaan (as rendered in English) resembles Canaan, 
    the promised land of the Israelites who also fled Egyptian persecution.
    Here we have two parallels, one of pure coincidence and another of some 
    substance, both encoded in the same word.
    Not only can we extract a thread of common history, but also of common destiny:
    practically the whole of the Western canon rests upon the shoulders of the 
    Greek and Hebrew traditions. What a treat then, that even in their earliest 
    stages, when the Israelites and Greeks knew very little of one another, 
    they already reflected each other in their mythologies, as if 
    to foreshadow their shared destiny.
</p>

<p>
    Danaan therefore takes on a special meaning in this website: 
    it refers to <i>a serendipitous clue, something seemingly innocuous which 
    returns with force at the end of the age</i>. We see it again and again 
    in science, in literature, in history. Danaan was present when 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek" target="_top">Leeuwenhoek</a> 
    first spied the microbe, when the Hobbits returned to the Shire 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scouring_of_the_Shire" 
    target="_top">only to find an unfamiliar land</a>, 
    and when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau" 
    target="_top">Jacob and Esau</a> made amends. Danaan reminds you 
    to pay attention: you never know what's important to the plot!

    I copied this template from that of <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">Fourmilab</a>,
    the website of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_(programmer)" target="_top">John Walker</a>,

    a company best known for its flagship product,

    serves as an inspiration for my own and I hope to respect his memory with this homage.
