<dd>
    To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not entirely sure. I have a lot of 
    ideas and documents floating around and I thought it would be fun to 
    have them all in one place. This should also serve as me "academic e-portfolio,"
    since that's something the youngins are looking for these days.

    I copied this template from that of <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">Fourmilab</a>,
    the website of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_(programmer)" target="_top">John Walker</a>, 
    founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk" target="_top">Autodesk, Inc.</a>,
    a company best known for its flagship product,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD" target="_top">AutoCAD</a>. His website 
    serves as an inspiration for my own and I hope to respect his memory with this homage.
