<dt><b><a name="what_is_ch" class="i">What's &ldquo;<tt>.ch</tt>&rdquo;?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Or, &ldquo;Are you really in China?&rdquo;</a></b></dt>

<dd><tt><b>.ch</b></tt> is the top-level domain name for
    <a href="/images/suisse_espace/">Switzerland</a>.
    &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;, you say&hellip;.  Well, though this is a
    small country (population about 8 million), there are four national
    languages, in each of which the country has a different name:

    <p />

    <center>
    <table cellpadding="0">
    <tr><td>German:</td> <td>Schweiz</td></tr>
    <tr><td>French:</td> <td>Suisse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Italian:</td> <td>Svizzera</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Romansch: &nbsp; </td> <td>Svizra</td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>

    <p />

    On bank notes and official documents there's plenty of room to
    include all the different languages, but coins, license plates,
    and domain names lack the real estate so the abbreviation of the Latin name
    &ldquo;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a href="http://www.admin.ch/" target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Confoederatio Helvetica</a></em>&rdquo;
    (Swiss Confederation) is used,
    which avoids giving preference to any of the national languages.
    Hence the &ldquo;<tt>.ch</tt>&rdquo; domain
    name, postal code, and country stickers on automobiles.
    China is <tt><b>.cn</b></tt>, by the way, and Chile
    is <tt><b>.cl</b></tt>.

    Can't you speak Latin?  <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Index Librorum Liberorum</cite> is Latin for &ldquo;List of Free Books&rdquo;,
    which seemed an excellent title for a site consisting primarily
    of public-domain software and documents.  It is a parody,
    of course, of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Index Librorum Prohibitorum</cite>,
    the list of books banned by the Roman Catholic Church.
    <em>Liberorum</em> is itself a Latin pun, meaning both free
    of charge and promoting liberty.

laboratory&rdquo;.  As it happens, I've been interested in
artificial life since the mid-1970s, long before it became respectable.
Ants and ant colonies always seemed to me to be the most
interesting models, since they exhibited complex emergent
behaviour with simple organisms and a limited number of
chemical signals.  When
<a href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/" target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Rudy Rucker</a>
and I were discussing his &ldquo;Artificial Life Lab&rdquo; program, I
often urged him to adopt an ant colony model for it.
Being a science fiction writer, he had his revenge upon me.
The villain of his 1994 novel
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568582471/fourmilabwwwfour" target="Amazon_Fourmilab">
<cite>The Hacker and the Ants</cite>
</a>
was based on me, with the final scene set in the building
which now contains the <tt><b>www.fourmilab.ch</b></tt> server.  But he laughs best who
<a href="/documents/hackants13.html">writes last</a>.
Amusingly, not long after the publication of
<cite>The Hacker and the Ants</cite>, the largest
interconnected network of ant colonies known as of that date was
discovered in the Jura mountains, not far from Fourmilab.

<dt><b><a name="email" class="i">What's your E-mail address?</a></b></dt>
<dd>I was forced to remove my E-mail address from pages on this site
    for two reasons, both regrettable.  First, any E-mail address on
    a Web page is quickly &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; by spam (unsolicited
    commercial E-mail) robots and becomes unusable due to the
    volume of junk mail which arrives.  Second, publishing one's
    E-mail address on pages as frequently visited as many
    on this site, and as likely to pop out of a search engine
    when lazy students seek answers to homework problems on the
    Web, guarantees you'll be bombarded with dozens, if not
    hundreds, of clueless questions every day.  I've
    published a collection of genuine E-mail which merited
    my <a href="/documents/titanium/"><cite>Titanium

<dd>A number of the documents on this site cite, as references, books you're
    unlikely to find at your local booksellers'.  This site, as an
    Amazon.com associate, allows you to order these books on-line, for
    delivery anywhere on Earth.  We receive a small credit when you buy
    a book we recommend from Amazon&mdash;if you have a Web page,
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/associates/" target="Amazon_Fourmilab">you can do 
    the same</a> for books you mention.
    Any revenue we receive from Amazon is a tiny fraction of the

<dd>The <tt><b>www.fourmilab.ch</b></tt> site is hosted
<img src="/images/Fourmilab/server_rack.jpg" alt="Fourmilab server farm"
     width="172" height="320" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" />
on a fully-redundant &ldquo;server farm&rdquo;
mounted in a rack in the Fourmilab Hall of the Servers.
The two boxes at the bottom are the
<a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/pedge_1850"
   target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Dell PowerEdge 1850</a> servers which host the
site.  Each has dual Intel Xeon 3.6 GHz hyper-threaded processors,
which   gives each server the equivalent of four CPUs.  Each has 8 Gb
of ECC RAM, dual 146 Gb 10,000 RPM SCSI drives on an embedded RAID
controller, and two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, which are &ldquo;bonded&rdquo;
into a single logical interface, with each physical interface
connected to one of the two 16 port
<a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/pwcnt_2616"
   target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Dell PowerConnect 2616</a> Gigabit Ethernet
switches at the top of the rack.
The interface to switch connections of the two servers are crossed
with respect to one another.  The two switches are connected together
and normally forward packets to one another; each is connected to the
DMZ port of one of the two redundant firewalls (which aren't in this
rack, but in the communications rack upstairs).  The network
architecture is described in this
<a href="/documents/system_narratives/network/"
   target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">sporadically updated drawing</a>.

<p>
Between the servers and switches are two identical
<a href="http://www.coyotepoint.com/" target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Coyote
Point</a>
<a href="http://www.coyotepoint.com/e350.htm"
   target="Fourmilog_Aux">Equalizer 350</a> load balancers run in
primary/backup high availability mode.
The top load balancer is connected to the top switch and the bottom
load balancer to the bottom switch.  Hence, they exchange heartbeats
through the interconnected switches, so if one switch goes down,
whichever load balancer is connected to the remaining switch will
become primary, and since each server has an interface connected to
both switches, it will continue to be able to communicate to both
servers.

For twenty-two years, I hosted Fourmilab with servers on-site.
Originally, the site was hosted on a Sun workstation, then
two generations of Sun servers.  The site then migrated to
Dell servers, and eventually a server farm with three servers
with redundant load balancers as a front-end which could divert
traffic in case of a server failure.

As of January 10th, 2016, Fourmilab has been hosted at
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">Amazon Web Services</a>,
(AWS) which provides a Linux/Apache environment which provides me
complete control over the configuration.  Moving Fourmilab's hosting
to AWS has reduced the cost of hosting the site by a factor of fifty
compared to local hosting and has reduced the anxiety when leaving
town, since the Amazon-hosted site can be administered from anywhere
in the world and has high availability and hardware redundancy.
Backup is provided by mirroring the site to other AWS regions which
can be activated if the primary site goes down or in the event of
a bad asteroid day, and by regularly mirroring the site to the
local in-house server which is backed up daily.

    Keep on programming, of course!
    Unscheduled electrical power outages are extremely rare in Switzerland;
    we've experienced less than an hour total at this site since 1992.  Much
    more worrisome is when things suddenly get <em>too bright</em>.  We're
    located on a plateau at an altitude of about 800 metres above sea level; in the summer
    we experience frequent violent thunderstorms, with an average of
    about four nearby lightning strikes per year which get into the power and telephone lines.
    Circumstances like these require comprehensive power
    protection, and we've found the <em>Smart-UPS</em> series
    Uninterruptible Power Sources (UPS) from
    <a href="http://www.apcc.com/" target="Fourmilab_FAQ_Aux">American Power Conversion</a>
    do the job superbly.  Since installing APC <em>Smart-UPS</em>
    units on all non-resistive loads in 1994, we have had zero equipment losses due
    to lightning strikes and zero downtime due to transient power outages.
    High-wattage equipment insensitive to power outages, such as
    laser printers and copiers, are protected by APC Line-R
    voltage regulator and load protection units; they provide
    the protection of a UPS without the backup battery power in
    case of outage.
