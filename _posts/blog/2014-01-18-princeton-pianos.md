I've played more piano since starting grad school than throughout my four years at McGill, thanks to the abundance of pianos on campus. The pianos' conditions range from excellent to passable, with some sporting [KÃ¶ln](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K%C3%B6ln_Concert#The_K.C3.B6ln_concert)-level limitations. However, I couldn't find a resource listing their locations.

Another 'open-sourced locations' project could be to document uncommon study spots. For example, if McGill libraries were crowded I could escape to Purvis Hall's [solarium](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.50447900000001%2C-73.58179800000002&cbp=%2C70.62%2C%2C2%2C-4.739998&layer=c&panoid=tTI0x7ujrMYKWjVhRAd7lw&spn=0.18000000000000788%2C0.30000000000001953&output=classic&cbll=45.504479%2C-73.581798), which was usually empty.

If I missed a piano, [shoot me an email](mailto:altosaar@princeton.edu) and I will add it to the map ([mobile-friendly link](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zZ0UKQQpeAC0.kCaCPXTnIEOo)):
