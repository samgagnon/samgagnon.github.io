Efforts to map the highly-redshifted 21-cm line are complicated by the prescence of foregrounds whose intensity exceeds the target signal by 5 orders of magnitude. Luckily, the foreground emissions are relegated to a well-defined region of Fourier space. See how we can exploit that to recover the underlying signal in my paper, [Recovering the Lost Wedge Modes in 21-cm Foregrounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08382), or get the tl;dr in my [10 minute summary of the project](https://youtu.be/FMLbTwHqf4s).
