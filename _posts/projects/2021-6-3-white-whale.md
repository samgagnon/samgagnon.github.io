The Hubble constant is a measure of the expansion rate of our universe. Two independent methods have each constrained the Hubble constant to two different values,
causing something of a rift in the cosmology community. Since this discrepancy arose, a third independent measurement of the Hubble constant has become the white whale
of cosmology. So-called "standard siren" measurements of binary neutron star mergers have arisen as one of the most promising methods. In this method, a binary neutron star merger's luminosity distance is produced from its gravitational wave signature, while a redshift is produced from its electromagnetic radiation. One measurement of this type was already performed in 2017, but the precision was too low to settle the dispute. Ten such events are expected to occur in the next observing run of LIGO, and I'm in the race to be ready for them.
